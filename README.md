## Description

This Project was created using Node.js, Express.js, and then deployed to Heroku. The purpose of this project was to learn how to use Express.js to create a local server and use get, post, and delete to modify data on the browser. I learned about how to use API endpoints to get, post, and delete data from the db.json file.

## Installation

Install the server.js file, the utils folder, the public folder, the routes folder, and the package.json folder to your computer. To use this application, the user must have Node.js and heroku installed. Once the user has these installed, they can open the terminal and type "node server" and a message "API server now on port 3001! View at : http://localhost:3001". 

## Usage

When the user opens up the link http://localhost:3001 it will bring them to a note taker application where they can create new notes and delete notes as well. The user can also vist the note taker with this link from Heroku: https://pacific-eyrie-88878.herokuapp.com. 

Here is a screenshot of what the Note taker application looks like in the browser:
